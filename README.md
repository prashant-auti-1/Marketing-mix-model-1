# Marketing-mix-model-1
This is my first repository on Github. This is my first attempt to perform marketing mix model in MS Excel spreadsheet.
The MS Excel file in this repository contains a marketing mix model with following sheets -
  1) Dataset - Dataset of digital channels marketing spends and sales 
  2) Exploration - Data exploration graphs, correlation matrix
  3) Simple model - Simple multilear regression model
  4) simple model transformed - Transformed values of parameters based on simple model
  5) Adstock and dim returns - Adversting adstock (carryover effect) and diminishing returns are caclucalted as a feature transforamtion. New regression model based is also created in the same sheet after feature transformation (adstock and diminishing returns)
  6) Final model - Has predicted values based on new regression model after feature transformation
  7) Forecasting - Forecasting of sales for future dates (few weeks)
